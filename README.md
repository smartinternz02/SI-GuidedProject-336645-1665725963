Flight price prediction Using IBM Watson
People who work frequently travel through flight will have better knowledge on best discount and right time to buy the ticket. For the business purpose many airline companies change prices according to the seasons or time duration. They will increase the price when people travel more. Estimating the highest prices  of the airlines data for the route is collected with features such as Duration, Source, Destination, Arrival and Departure. Features are taken from chosen dataset and in the price wherein the airline price ticket costs vary overtime. we have implemented flight price prediction for users by using KNN, decision tree and random forest algorithms. Random Forest  shows the best accuracy of 80% for predicting the flight price. also, we have done correlation tests and metrics for the statistical analysis.
